#summary Provides a simple management monitoring capability.

= Introduction =

This service can be used to add _monitors_ to bundles and services to enable remote access to counters and statistics for services. The main service allows for the creation and removal of individual monitors, a listener service allows clients to detect the addition and removal of monitors as well as, in some cases, updates to monitors.

= Details =

A monitor is a named value that provides insight into the behavior of a bundle or service. Specifically a monitor can be one of:

 * Counter - discrete count of actions such as page hits, size of cache, etc.
 * Statistic - maintains a value over time providing min, max and average values.
 * Timer Statistic - similar to a statistic but instead of dealing with numeric values it deals in durations.

The bundle provides:

 * The monitor service itself to create and remove monitors and to enumerate existing monitors.
 * The monitor listener service to allow clients to detect new monitors and removal of monitors.
 * A command provider to allow enumeration of monitors from the OSGi shell.
 * A Servlet that will be registered if there is an available Http Service and can emit the monitor data as JSON data for remote monitoring tools.
