 * This package provides some basic support for parallel functional and general

 *   <li>Parallel versions of some of the functional programming tools in the 
 *   class {@link org.johnstonshome.utils.fun.Functional}.</li>
 *   <li>Promise-based function chains to perform operations in sequence when
 *   a value is made available, either synchronously or asynchronously.</em>
